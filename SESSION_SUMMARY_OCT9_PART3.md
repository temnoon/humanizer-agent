## 🚀 Next Steps (Week 4+)

### Priority 1: Reach 500 Pairs Milestone

**Target**: +104 pairs → 500 total
**Focus Areas**:
- Customer support (25 pairs) - FAQs, troubleshooting
- Marketing copy (25 pairs) - Ad copy, landing pages
- News articles (25 pairs) - Press → accessible news
- Government documents (25 pairs) - Policy → plain language
- Miscellaneous improvements (4 pairs)

**Timeline**: 1-2 sessions

### Priority 2: Fix Strength Parameter

**Issue**: Strength 0.5 and 1.8 produce identical outputs
**Solution**: Implement explicit strength examples in `llm_rewriter.py`
**Timeline**: 30 minutes
**File**: `backend/services/llm_rewriter.py:168-200`

### Priority 3: Continue to 1000 Pairs (Original Goal)

**Remaining**: 500 → 1000 = +500 pairs
**Approach**:
- Add 15-20 pairs per existing domain for depth
- Target specialized niches (healthcare, legal subspecialties)
- Expand existing strong domains (legal, medical, finance)

**Timeline**: 3-5 more sessions
