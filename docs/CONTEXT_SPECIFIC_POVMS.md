## Overview

### The Limitation of Universal Axes

The six core universal POVMs (Literal↔Metaphorical, etc.) apply to **any text**.

But **not every text needs all six**, and **every text has unique dialectics**.

**Example:**

Reading **Moby Dick:**
- Universal axes miss: **Obsession ↔ Acceptance**
- This dialectic is CENTRAL to the narrative
- Without measuring it, you miss what the text is actually about

Reading **a cookbook:**
- Universal axes include: **Emotional ↔ Analytical**
- But a cookbook isn't engaging emotions (usually)
- Measuring this axis wastes time, generates noise

### What are Context-Specific POVMs?

**Context-Specific (Emergent) POVMs** are dialectical measurement axes that:

1. **Arise from the text itself** - Generated by LLM after reading enough to identify core tensions
2. **Capture narrative-specific dynamics** - What THIS text is wrestling with
3. **Complement universal axes** - Used alongside (not instead of) core six
4. **Remain temporary** - Active only while reading this text

**Examples:**

| Text | Context-Specific Axes |
|------|----------------------|
| Moby Dick | Obsession ↔ Acceptance, Vengeance ↔ Forgiveness |
| Technical API docs | Procedural ↔ Conceptual, Prescriptive ↔ Descriptive |
| Meditation manual | Striving ↔ Allowing, Concentration ↔ Openness |
| Political essay | Collectivist ↔ Individualist, Idealist ↔ Pragmatist |
| Poetry collection | Sound ↔ Sense, Image ↔ Abstraction |

### How They're Generated

**Two triggering conditions:**

1. **Initial text analysis** - After reading ~1000 words, LLM proposes axes
2. **User request** - "What are the core dialectics in this text?"

**Process:**
```
Text sample → LLM analyzes themes/tensions → Proposes 2-4 axes →
Validates via Madhyamaka criteria → User approves → Axes become active
```

---

## Why Context-Specific Axes?

### Problem 1: Universal Axes Miss Specificity

**Example: Reading Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations***

**Universal axes applied:**
- Literal ↔ Metaphorical: *(Most sentences are fairly literal advice)*
- Surface ↔ Depth: *(Some depth, but not the core dynamic)*
- Subjective ↔ Objective: *(Presents as objective wisdom)*

**Missing:** The text's ACTUAL central tension:
- **Acceptance ↔ Control**

Stoicism is fundamentally about accepting what you can't control while controlling what you can. This dialectic appears in EVERY passage.

**Context-specific axis:**
```
Acceptance ↔ Control

Acceptance (0.6): "Accept what happens as it happens"
Control (0.1): Minimal emphasis on agency here
Both (0.3): Accept fate AND control reactions to it
Neither (0.0): Not transcendent of this frame
```

**This reveals the text's philosophical structure.**

### Problem 2: Narrative Arcs Require Dynamic Axes

**Example: Reading a hero's journey story**

**Early in story:**
- Protagonist is cowardly (avoids adventure)
- Measures high on: **Safety ↔ Risk** (choosing safety)

**Middle of story:**
- Protagonist faces trials
- Measures shift: **Cowardice ↔ Courage**

**End of story:**
- Protagonist integrated
- New axis emerges: **Ego ↔ Service** (heroism isn't about personal glory)

**Universal axes wouldn't track this evolution.**

Context-specific axes can be **generated at different story stages** to capture the current dialectical tension.

### Problem 3: Domain-Specific Language Needs Domain Axes

**Example: Reading a machine learning research paper**

**Universal axis: Literal ↔ Metaphorical**
- Result: 0.85 literal (it's technical)
- Not very informative

**Context-specific axis: Theoretical ↔ Empirical**
```
Theoretical (0.4): Mathematical derivation of algorithm
Empirical (0.4): Experimental results on datasets
Both (0.15): Theory predicts empirical outcomes
Neither (0.05): Not particularly transcendent
```

**Much more useful for understanding the paper's argument structure.**

### Problem 4: Reader's Purpose Determines Relevance

**Same text, different purposes:**

**Text:** *The Tao Te Ching*

**Reader A (Scholar):**
Wants context-specific axes:
- **Original Taoism ↔ Buddhist Influence**
- **Mystical ↔ Political**

**Reader B (Practitioner):**
Wants different context-specific axes:
- **Effort ↔ Effortlessness** (wu wei)
- **Attachment ↔ Release**

**The LLM can generate axes based on user's stated purpose.**

---

## Generation Process

### Step 1: Text Sampling

**How much text does the LLM need?**

- **Minimum:** 500 words (detect basic themes)
- **Better:** 1000-2000 words (identify sustained tensions)
- **Ideal:** 5000+ words (see narrative arc)

**Sampling strategy:**
- First 500 words (introduction, tone-setting)
- Middle 500 words (core content)
- Last 500 words (conclusion, resolution)
- Plus: Any section user flags as significant

### Step 2: Dialectical Analysis

**LLM prompt:**

```
You are analyzing a text to identify its core dialectical tensions.

TEXT SAMPLE:
{text_sample}

READER'S PURPOSE (if specified):
{reader_purpose}

TASK:
Identify 2-4 dialectical axes that are CENTRAL to this text. These should be:

1. Actually dialectical (poles that mutually define each other)
2. Central to the text's meaning (not peripheral)
3. Not already covered by universal axes:
   - Literal ↔ Metaphorical
   - Surface ↔ Depth
   - Subjective ↔ Objective
   - Coherent ↔ Surprising
   - Emotional ↔ Analytical
   - Specific ↔ Universal

For each proposed axis:
- Name both poles clearly
- Explain why this dialectic is central to the text
- Provide 2-3 example passages that engage this tension
- Verify it passes Madhyamaka criteria (mutual dependence, no privileged pole, etc.)

OUTPUT:
{json_schema for proposed axes}
```

**Example output:**

```json
{
  "proposed_axes": [
    {
      "name": "Obsession ↔ Acceptance",
      "pole_a": "Obsession",
      "pole_b": "Acceptance",
      "centrality_explanation": "Ahab's monomanaical pursuit of the white whale vs. Starbuck's plea to accept loss and move on is the narrative's core tension",
      "example_passages": [
        "Ahab: 'He tasks me; he heaps me...'",
        "Starbuck: 'Let us fly these deadly waters...'",
        "Ishmael: observes both positions, caught between"
      ],
      "madhyamaka_validation": {
        "no_privileged_pole": true,
        "poles_explanation": "Neither obsession nor acceptance is presented as inherently better. Ahab's obsession is both tragic and magnificent. Acceptance could be wisdom or cowardice.",
        "mutual_dependence": true,
        "dependence_explanation": "Obsession only meaningful against acceptance as alternative. Acceptance only meaningful when obsession is possible.",
        "both_corner_coherent": true,
        "both_explanation": "Characters can be obsessed AND accepting (Ishmael accepts fate while remaining engaged)",
        "neither_corner_coherent": true,
        "neither_explanation": "Transcendence of both (mystical whale itself, beyond human categories)"
      },
      "confidence": 0.95
    },
    {
      "name": "Vengeance ↔ Forgiveness",
      "pole_a": "Vengeance",
      "pole_b": "Forgiveness",
      "centrality_explanation": "Related to obsession axis but more specifically about moral response to injury",
      "example_passages": ["..."],
      "madhyamaka_validation": {...},
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ],
  "axes_count": 2,
  "recommended": ["Obsession ↔ Acceptance"]
}
```

### Step 3: User Review & Approval

**Don't auto-apply generated axes.** Let user review:

```
The system has identified potential measurement axes for this text:

1. **Obsession ↔ Acceptance**
   Central because: Ahab vs. Starbuck, core narrative tension
   Confidence: 95%

2. **Vengeance ↔ Forgiveness**
   Central because: Ahab's motivation, moral dimension
   Confidence: 85%

Apply these axes? [Yes / No / Modify]

If "Yes": Both axes active for remainder of reading
If "No": Use only universal axes
If "Modify": User can edit axis names or provide feedback
```

**This keeps user in control.** The LLM proposes, user disposes.

### Step 4: Integration with Universal Axes

Once approved, context-specific axes are **added to** (not replacing) universal axes.

**Total active axes:**
```
Universal (always active):
1. Literal ↔ Metaphorical
2. Surface ↔ Depth
3. Subjective ↔ Objective
4. Coherent ↔ Surprising
5. Emotional ↔ Analytical
6. Specific ↔ Universal

Context-Specific (for this text):
7. Obsession ↔ Acceptance
8. Vengeance ↔ Forgiveness
```

**Measurement strategy:**
- Apply 2-3 universal axes per sentence (most relevant)
- Apply ALL context-specific axes (they're specifically tailored)
- Total measurements per sentence: 4-5 axes

### Step 5: Evolution During Reading

**Context-specific axes can change** as narrative evolves.

**Example: Reading a bildungsroman (coming-of-age story)**

**Chapters 1-5:**
- Active axis: **Innocence ↔ Experience**

**Chapters 6-10:**
- Previous axis less relevant (character no longer innocent)
- New axis emerges: **Conformity ↔ Rebellion**

**Chapters 11-15:**
- Integration phase
- New axis: **Individual ↔ Community**

**LLM can propose axis updates:**
```
The narrative tension has shifted. Consider replacing:
  OLD: Innocence ↔ Experience (no longer active)
  NEW: Individual ↔ Community (now central)

Approve axis evolution? [Yes / No]
```

## Madhyamaka Validation for Generated Axes

### The Challenge

Universal axes are pre-validated. But **generated axes must be checked** to avoid:

1. **Privileged poles** (eternalism)
2. **Non-dialectical pairs** (independent variables)
3. **Incoherent BOTH/NEITHER corners**

### Validation Checklist

For each proposed axis, LLM must verify:

#### Check 1: Are poles mutually defining?

**Test:** Can you define pole A without reference to pole B?

✅ **Obsession ↔ Acceptance**
- Obsession only makes sense against acceptance as alternative
- Acceptance implies something that could be obsessed over
- Mutually defining

❌ **Detailed ↔ Humorous**
- Can have detail without humor
- Can have humor without detail
- Independent variables, not dialectical

#### Check 2: Is there a privileged pole?

**Test:** Does the text (or LLM) treat one pole as "better"?

✅ **Striving ↔ Allowing** (in meditation manual)
- Neither is better
- Striving has place (developing concentration)
- Allowing has place (letting go)
- Dialectical tension is productive

❌ **Ignorance ↔ Enlightenment** (in same meditation manual)
- Enlightenment is CLEARLY privileged
- This is the goal, ignorance is problem
- Not Madhyamaka-valid (eternalism)

**Fix:** Reframe as **Grasping ↔ Releasing**
- Now neither pole privileged
- Both are actions, both have contexts
- Valid dialectic

#### Check 3: Can BOTH be coherent (not paradoxical)?

**Test:** Can something embody both poles simultaneously in meaningful way?

✅ **Vengeance ↔ Forgiveness**
- BOTH: "I forgive you, but justice must be served"
- Coherent superposition
- Not just middle point, but genuine both-ness

❌ **Alive ↔ Dead**
- BOTH: ???
- Paradoxical, not productive
- (Unless discussing Schrödinger's cat, where paradox is the point)

#### Check 4: Can NEITHER be meaningful (not just absence)?

**Test:** Does NEITHER point to transcendence of the frame?

✅ **Obsession ↔ Acceptance** (Moby Dick)
- NEITHER: The white whale itself
- Transcends human categories of obsession/acceptance
- Points to the numinous, ineffable

❌ **Loud ↔ Quiet**
- NEITHER: Medium volume?
- Just a third category
- Not transcendent

#### Check 5: Does it reveal construction (not reify)?

**Test:** Does the axis help reader see their own interpretive process?

✅ **Theoretical ↔ Empirical** (ML paper)
- Reader notices: "I privilege empirical results over theory" (bias visible)
- Or: "I'm dismissing experimental validation" (bias visible)
- Construction revealed

❌ **True ↔ False**
- Reifies truth as inherent in text
- Hides reader's role in judgment
- Not consciousness-revealing

### Auto-Validation Prompt

**LLM validates its own proposed axes:**

```
For the proposed axis "{pole_a} ↔ {pole_b}", verify:

1. Mutual Dependence:
   - Can I define {pole_a} without reference to {pole_b}? [Yes/No]
   - Can I define {pole_b} without reference to {pole_a}? [Yes/No]
   - If both "No", proceed. If either "Yes", REJECT axis.

2. No Privileged Pole:
   - Does this text treat {pole_a} as better? [Yes/No/Unclear]
   - Does this text treat {pole_b} as better? [Yes/No/Unclear]
   - If either "Yes", REJECT axis (or reframe).

3. BOTH Corner:
   - Provide an example where something is both {pole_a} AND {pole_b}: [example]
   - Is this coherent (not paradoxical)? [Yes/No]
   - If "No", REJECT axis.

4. NEITHER Corner:
   - Provide an example where something is neither {pole_a} NOR {pole_b}: [example]
   - Is this transcendent (not just a third category)? [Yes/No]
   - If "No", flag as WEAK (don't reject, but note).

5. Reveals Construction:
   - How does measuring this axis reveal reader's interpretive frame?: [explanation]
   - If unclear, flag as WEAK.

RESULT: [ACCEPT / REJECT / REVISE]

If REVISE, provide suggested reframing: [new poles]
```

## Examples by Genre

### Literary Fiction: *The Great Gatsby*

**Context-Specific Axes:**

**1. Illusion ↔ Reality**
- Pole A (Illusion): Gatsby's constructed identity, the American Dream
- Pole B (Reality): His actual past, the emptiness behind wealth
- BOTH: Illusion IS reality for Gatsby (belief makes it real)
- NEITHER: The green light (transcends real/illusion)

**2. Idealism ↔ Cynicism**
- Pole A (Idealism): Gatsby's faith in recapturing the past
- Pole B (Cynicism): Nick's growing disillusionment
- BOTH: Nick is idealistically drawn to Gatsby's dream while cynically observing its futility
- NEITHER: Daisy (beyond both, pure superficiality)

**Why these axes matter:**
- Capture the novel's core themes
- Universal axes would miss the specific tension between appearance and reality
- Every scene can be measured along these axes

### Technical Documentation: *Kubernetes API Reference*

**Context-Specific Axes:**

**1. Procedural ↔ Conceptual**
- Pole A (Procedural): Step-by-step how-to
- Pole B (Conceptual): Architectural explanation
- BOTH: "This command creates a pod (procedural) which is the atomic unit of deployment (conceptual)"
- NEITHER: Pure reference (just lists parameters, no procedure or concept)

**2. Prescriptive ↔ Descriptive**
- Pole A (Prescriptive): "You should do X"
- Pole B (Descriptive): "The system does Y"
- BOTH: "When you invoke Z, the system will respond W" (user action + system behavior)
- NEITHER: Examples without explanation

**Why these axes matter:**
- Technical docs mix procedural/conceptual constantly
- Universal "Specific ↔ Universal" doesn't capture this nuance
- Helps reader identify if they're getting actionable steps vs. understanding

### Contemplative Practice: *The Tibetan Book of the Dead*

**Context-Specific Axes:**

**1. Recognition ↔ Distraction**
- Pole A (Recognition): Recognizing dharmakāya, clear light
- Pole B (Distraction): Falling into bardo, reacting to visions
- BOTH: Using distraction as path (wrathful deities as recognition trigger)
- NEITHER: Beyond recognition/distraction (rigpa itself)

**2. Liberation ↔ Rebirth**
- Pole A (Liberation): Dissolution into dharmakāya
- Pole B (Rebirth): Taking a new form
- BOTH: Liberation THROUGH rebirth (choosing incarnation consciously)
- NEITHER: The bardo state itself (between death and birth)

**Why these axes matter:**
- Text is ABOUT navigating these dialectics
- Universal axes miss the specific spiritual framework
- Each instruction can be measured: Does it point toward recognition or manage distraction?

### Political Philosophy: *The Communist Manifesto*

**Context-Specific Axes:**

**1. Collectivist ↔ Individualist**
- Pole A (Collectivist): Class consciousness, solidarity
- Pole B (Individualist): Bourgeois individualism
- BOTH: Individual liberation through collective action
- NEITHER: (Weak NEITHER—text doesn't transcend this frame much)

**2. Revolutionary ↔ Reformist**
- Pole A (Revolutionary): Overthrow existing order
- Pole B (Reformist): Gradual change within system
- BOTH: Some reforms prepare ground for revolution
- NEITHER: Anarchist critique (neither state reform nor state revolution)

**Why these axes matter:**
- Capture the manifesto's political framework
- Universal "Subjective ↔ Objective" less useful (text presents as objective)
- Measuring revolutionary/reformist reveals the argument's structure

### Poetry: *The Waste Land* (T.S. Eliot)

**Context-Specific Axes:**

**1. Fragmentation ↔ Unity**
- Pole A (Fragmentation): Disconnected images, multiple voices
- Pole B (Unity): Underlying mythic structure
- BOTH: Fragments that cohere into pattern
- NEITHER: The gaps, the silences between fragments

**2. Sound ↔ Sense**
- Pole A (Sound): Musicality, rhythm, verbal texture
- Pole B (Sense): Semantic meaning, reference
- BOTH: Sound that MEANS (onomatopoeia, rhythm as meaning)
- NEITHER: Pure image (visual, not sonic or semantic)

**Why these axes matter:**
- Modernist poetry specifically engages fragmentation/unity
- Universal "Literal ↔ Metaphorical" doesn't capture sound/sense tension
- Measuring these reveals how the poem works

## LLM Initiative: Detecting Imbalance

### The Madhyamaka Eye

Part of the LLM's role: **Notice when dialectics are unbalanced**.

This isn't just validation during generation. It's **ongoing monitoring** during reading.

### What is Imbalance?

**Imbalanced dialectic** = One pole is over-privileged, suppressing the other.

**Signs of imbalance:**

1. **Eternalism:** One pole treated as inherently real/good
   - Example: "Rational ↔ Emotional" where rational is always better

2. **Nihilism:** Both poles denied without functional alternative
   - Example: "Everything is meaningless, distinctions don't matter"

3. **Hidden privileging:** Claims middle path but subtly favors one pole
   - Example: "Both logic and intuition are valid" (but only gives logical arguments)

### LLM Detection Strategy

**While measuring along an axis, LLM checks:**

```
Over last N sentences, what's the probability distribution?

Pole A: [p_a_1, p_a_2, ..., p_a_n]
Pole B: [p_b_1, p_b_2, ..., p_b_n]
Both: [p_both_1, p_both_2, ..., p_both_n]
Neither: [p_neither_1, p_neither_2, ..., p_neither_n]

Calculate means:
mean_a = avg(p_a_i)
mean_b = avg(p_b_i)
mean_both = avg(p_both_i)
mean_neither = avg(p_neither_i)

DETECT IMBALANCE:
If mean_a > 0.7 and mean_b < 0.1:
  → Pole A is privileged (possible eternalism)

If mean_both < 0.05 across all measurements:
  → Dialectic may be false (poles aren't truly interpenetrating)

If mean_neither > 0.6 consistently:
  → Text may be nihilistic OR transcendent (investigate)
```

### LLM Alert to User

**When imbalance detected:**

```
⚠️ Madhyamaka Imbalance Detected

Axis: Rational ↔ Emotional
Imbalance: RATIONAL pole heavily privileged

Evidence:
- Last 20 sentences: Rational=0.78 avg, Emotional=0.08 avg
- BOTH corner rarely active (0.05 avg)
- Text consistently treats rationality as superior

This may indicate:
1. The text has an eternalist bias (reifying rationality)
2. OR: The content is legitimately focused on rational analysis (balanced in context)

Reflection prompt:
- Is this text presenting one pole as inherently better?
- Am I agreeing with that privileging uncritically?
- What would an emotional reading reveal that I'm missing?

Continue reading? [Yes / Yes with awareness / Pause for reflection]
```

**This is consciousness work in action.**

### Examples of Imbalance Detection

#### Example 1: Self-Help Book (Eternalism)

**Context-Specific Axis Generated:** Achievement ↔ Acceptance

**Measurements over 50 sentences:**
- Achievement: 0.82 avg
- Acceptance: 0.05 avg
- Both: 0.10 avg
- Neither: 0.03 avg

**LLM Alert:**
```
This text heavily privileges Achievement over Acceptance.
Nearly every sentence frames acceptance as failure.

Madhyamaka concern: Achievement is being reified as inherently good.

Consider: What if acceptance isn't resignation but wisdom?
The text isn't offering that perspective.

Are you absorbing this imbalance?
```

#### Example 2: Deconstructive Philosophy (Nihilism Risk)

**Context-Specific Axis Generated:** Meaning ↔ Meaninglessness

**Measurements over 50 sentences:**
- Meaning: 0.08 avg
- Meaninglessness: 0.65 avg
- Both: 0.15 avg
- Neither: 0.12 avg

**LLM Alert:**
```
This text heavily privileges Meaninglessness over Meaning.
Risk of nihilistic reading (confusing emptiness with nothingness).

Madhyamaka reminder: Emptiness (śūnyatā) ≠ Meaninglessness

Even if meaning is constructed (not inherent), it still functions.
The text may be denying conventional truth.

How are you responding emotionally?
- If despairing: This may be nihilism, not insight
- If liberated: Check—are you bypassing conventional reality?
```

#### Example 3: Balanced Text (Healthy Dialectic)

**Context-Specific Axis Generated:** Individual ↔ Community

**Measurements over 50 sentences:**
- Individual: 0.35 avg
- Community: 0.30 avg
- Both: 0.25 avg
- Neither: 0.10 avg

**LLM Note:**
```
✓ This axis shows healthy balance.

Neither pole privileged.
BOTH corner active (interpenetration acknowledged).
NEITHER present but not dominant (some transcendence).

This text seems to hold the tension skillfully.
```

**No alert needed—user is reading balanced dialectic.**

## Integration with Universal POVMs

### When to Use Which?

**Universal POVMs:**
- Always active (part of baseline measurement set)
- Apply selectively (choose 2-3 most relevant per sentence)
- Foundational (semantic, hermeneutic, epistemic, cognitive)

**Context-Specific POVMs:**
- Generated after initial reading
- Apply to EVERY sentence (they're tailored to this text)
- Thematic (capture what THIS text is wrestling with)

### Measurement Order

**For each sentence:**

1. **Start with 1-2 universal axes**
   - Usually: Literal ↔ Metaphorical (semantic baseline)
   - Optionally: One other based on text type

2. **Then all context-specific axes**
   - These reveal narrative-specific tensions

3. **Optionally: Additional universal axes**
   - If user requests deep analysis

**Example (reading Moby Dick):**

**Sentence:** "Ahab stood alone, fixed on the horizon where the white whale might breach."

**Measurements:**

1. **Literal ↔ Metaphorical** (Universal)
   - Literal: 0.4, Metaphorical: 0.3, Both: 0.25, Neither: 0.05
   - Somewhat literal (he's physically standing) but "fixed" suggests psychological state

2. **Obsession ↔ Acceptance** (Context-Specific)
   - Obsession: 0.75, Acceptance: 0.05, Both: 0.15, Neither: 0.05
   - Clearly obsessive stance, fixed attention, no acceptance

3. **Emotional ↔ Analytical** (Universal, optional)
   - Emotional: 0.6, Analytical: 0.2, Both: 0.15, Neither: 0.05
   - Strong emotional charge (obsession is felt)

**Result:** 3 axes measured, revealing semantic, thematic, and affective dimensions

### Axis Priority

**If limited measurement budget (e.g., quick reading):**

Priority order:
1. **All context-specific axes** (most informative for THIS text)
2. **Literal ↔ Metaphorical** (semantic baseline)
3. **Coherent ↔ Surprising** (reveals reader's frame alignment)
4. **Other universal axes** (as time permits)

**If deep reading (comprehensive analysis):**

Apply all axes:
- 6 universal
- 2-4 context-specific
- Total: 8-10 axes per sentence

---

## Summary

### Key Principles

1. **Universal axes are necessary but not sufficient** - They miss narrative-specific dialectics
2. **Context-specific axes emerge from text** - LLM generates after sampling
3. **User approval required** - Don't auto-apply generated axes
4. **Madhyamaka validation crucial** - Check for privileged poles, incoherent corners
5. **LLM monitors for imbalance** - Alerts user to eternalism/nihilism risks
6. **Integration not replacement** - Context-specific axes complement universal ones

### The Innovation

**This is the key innovation you requested:**

> "While having curated POVMs that are lexically proper dialectics, there should still be some consideration to adding a couple of POVMs to include specific context and content of the narrative in question."

**What we've built:**

✅ Curated universal POVMs (6 core axes, rigorously validated)
✅ Context-specific POVM generation (LLM proposes narrative-tailored axes)
✅ Madhyamaka validation for generated axes (prevents imbalance)
✅ LLM initiative in detecting imbalance (alerts user to privileged poles)
✅ Integration strategy (both types working together)
