## Overview

### What are Universal POVMs?

**Universal (Curated) POVMs** are dialectical measurement axes that apply to **any text**, regardless of content, genre, or context.

They measure fundamental aspects of how meaning arises in reading:
- Semantic reference (literal vs metaphorical)
- Hermeneutic depth (surface vs depth)
- Epistemic stance (subjective vs objective)
- Temporal coherence (coherent vs surprising)
- Cognitive mode (emotional vs analytical)
- Scope of reference (specific vs universal)

### Contrast with Context-Specific POVMs

| Universal POVMs | Context-Specific POVMs |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Apply to any text | Emerge from specific narrative |
| Pre-defined | Generated by LLM during reading |
| 6-8 core axes | Unlimited, as needed |
| Always available | Appear when relevant |
| Example: Literal ↔ Metaphorical | Example: Obsession ↔ Acceptance (for Moby Dick) |

**Both are needed.** Universal axes provide foundational measurements. Context-specific axes capture what's unique to each narrative.

---

## Design Principles

### Madhyamaka Criteria

Every axis must satisfy:

1. **No privileged pole** - Neither side is "better" or "more correct"
2. **Mutual dependence** - Each pole defines/requires the other
3. **Empty of inherent existence** - The axis itself is constructed, not inherent in text
4. **Conventionally functional** - Useful for communication (not nihilism)

### Catuskoti Structure

Every axis has **four corners** (not binary):

1. **Pole A** (TRUE, NOT B) - Sentence embodies first pole, not second
2. **Pole B** (FALSE, NOT A) - Sentence embodies second pole, not first
3. **BOTH** (A AND B) - Sentence simultaneously embodies both poles
4. **NEITHER** (NOT A, NOT B) - Sentence transcends the axis entirely

### Validation Questions

For each proposed axis, ask:

**Q1: Are the poles actually dialectical opposites?**
- ❌ Bad: "Assertive ↔ Warm" (not opposites, can be both independent of dialectic)
- ✅ Good: "Literal ↔ Metaphorical" (mutually defining semantic modes)

**Q2: Can BOTH be coherent (not just a middle point)?**
- ❌ Bad: "True ↔ False" (BOTH creates paradox, not richness)
- ✅ Good: "Emotional ↔ Analytical" (BOTH is aesthetic experience)

**Q3: Can NEITHER be meaningful (not just absence)?**
- ❌ Bad: "Long ↔ Short" (NEITHER = medium length? Not transcendent)
- ✅ Good: "Subjective ↔ Objective" (NEITHER = non-dual awareness)

**Q4: Does the axis reveal construction?**
- ❌ Bad: "Correct ↔ Incorrect" (reifies truth as inherent)
- ✅ Good: "Coherent ↔ Surprising" (shows reader's frame at work)

## The Six Core Axes

### 1. Literal ↔ Metaphorical
**Semantic Reference Mode**

#### Description
Measures how the sentence refers to its content: through direct correspondence (literal) or indirect pointing (metaphorical).

#### The Four Corners

**1.1 LITERAL (TRUE, NOT METAPHORICAL)**
- Sentence describes actual objects, events, or states
- Words map directly to referents
- Interpretation requires minimal inference

**Example:** "The database contains 10,000 records."
- Probability: 0.85
- Evidence: Direct factual statement about technical reality

**1.2 METAPHORICAL (FALSE, NOT LITERAL)**
- Sentence points beyond surface meaning
- Words evoke conceptual mappings
- Interpretation requires inference, analogy, or symbolic reading

**Example:** "Hope is a bird that perches in the soul."
- Probability: 0.90
- Evidence: Hope is not literally avian; requires metaphorical interpretation

**1.3 BOTH (LITERAL AND METAPHORICAL)**
- Sentence is true both at surface level AND as pointer beyond itself
- Power comes from simultaneous readings
- Collapsing to either pole alone loses meaning

**Example:** "The archive remembers what you forget."
- Probability: 0.70
- Evidence: Archives DO store data (literal) AND "remembers" personifies them (metaphorical). Sentence works through both simultaneously.

**1.4 NEITHER (NOT LITERAL, NOT METAPHORICAL)**
- Sentence transcends semantic reference entirely
- May be nonsensical, paradoxical, or meta-linguistic
- Questions the literal/metaphorical distinction itself

**Example:** "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."
- Probability: 0.85
- Evidence: Syntactically valid but semantically void. Not describing (literal) or pointing (metaphorical). Reveals language's construction.

#### Why This Axis Matters

**Makes visible:** How readers negotiate semantic reference.

When you read "The market crashed," do you see:
- Literal: Economic metrics declined (0.5)
- Metaphorical: Financial system as fragile structure (0.3)
- Both: Economic fact + structural metaphor (0.15)
- Neither: Questioning if "market" even exists as entity (0.05)

**Your measurement reveals YOUR relationship to language.**

---

### 2. Surface ↔ Depth
**Hermeneutic Layer**

#### Description
Measures whether meaning resides at the explicit level (surface) or requires excavation of hidden/implied content (depth).

#### The Four Corners

**2.1 SURFACE (EXPLICIT, NOT HIDDEN)**
- Meaning is stated directly
- No subtext or hidden layers
- What's said = what's meant

**Example:** "Click the button to save your changes."
- Probability: 0.95
- Evidence: Instructional, no hidden meaning

**2.2 DEPTH (IMPLICIT, NOT EXPLICIT)**
- Meaning is hidden, implied, or subtextual
- Requires reading between lines
- What's said ≠ what's meant

**Example:** "I'm fine." (said with clenched jaw)
- Probability: 0.80
- Evidence: Explicit meaning contradicts implicit emotional state

**2.3 BOTH (SURFACE AND DEPTH)**
- Operates simultaneously at multiple levels
- Surface meaning is real AND depth is present
- Layered interpretation

**Example:** "It's a beautiful day." (at a funeral)
- Probability: 0.75
- Evidence: Surface = weather observation. Depth = ironic comment on tragedy. Both active.

**2.4 NEITHER (NOT SURFACE, NOT DEPTH)**
- Resists hermeneutic excavation
- Meaning is immediate presence, not layered
- Transcends surface/depth distinction

**Example:** "Now." (in meditation instruction)
- Probability: 0.70
- Evidence: Not describing surface facts, not hiding depth. Pure pointing to present moment.

#### Why This Axis Matters

**Makes visible:** Your interpretive labor.

Some readers are **surface-habitual** (take things at face value).
Some readers are **depth-habitual** (always looking for hidden meaning).

**Catuskoti reveals:**
- When depth-reading is appropriate (DEPTH corner high)
- When it's over-interpretation (SURFACE corner high, but you forced depth)
- When text rewards both (BOTH corner high)

**Meta-awareness:** "Am I projecting depth, or is it there?"

---

### 3. Subjective ↔ Objective
**Epistemic Stance**

#### Description
Measures whether meaning is located in the reader's construction (subjective) or in the text's inherent properties (objective).

**CRITICAL MADHYAMAKA CAVEAT:** This axis itself is empty (no inherent objectivity exists). But it's conventionally useful.

#### The Four Corners

**3.1 SUBJECTIVE (MY CONSTRUCTION, NOT TEXT-INHERENT)**
- Meaning arises from my frame, not text
- Different readers will construct different meanings
- Acknowledges interpretive agency

**Example:** "This sentence is beautiful."
- Probability: 0.90
- Evidence: "Beautiful" is aesthetic judgment from my perspective

**3.2 OBJECTIVE (TEXT-INHERENT, NOT MY CONSTRUCTION)**
- Meaning appears to be in the text itself
- Most readers would agree
- Feels independent of interpretation

**Example:** "2 + 2 = 4."
- Probability: 0.85
- Evidence: Mathematical truth seems objective (though even this is constructed via axioms)

**3.3 BOTH (INTERSUBJECTIVE CONSTRUCTION)**
- Meaning is shared social construction
- Not purely subjective (we agree) nor purely objective (still constructed)
- Consensus reality

**Example:** "Justice requires equality."
- Probability: 0.70
- Evidence: Feels objective (moral truth) but is actually shared cultural construction

**3.4 NEITHER (NON-DUAL AWARENESS)**
- The subjective/objective distinction dissolves
- Seeing construction without claiming either pole
- Direct awareness

**Example:** "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"
- Probability: 0.65
- Evidence: Koan transcends subject/object split. Neither subjective interpretation nor objective answer.

#### Why This Axis Matters

**Makes visible:** The reification of objectivity.

Most damaging beliefs masquerade as "objective truth":
- "Success is essential for happiness" (feels objective, is subjective)
- "Language is the foundation of reality" (feels objective, is constructed)

**Measuring BOTH (intersubjective) reveals:**
"This isn't my private delusion (subjective) nor absolute truth (objective). It's shared construction I can examine."

**Measuring NEITHER opens:**
Non-dual seeing. Beyond subject/object entirely.

---

### 4. Coherent ↔ Surprising
**Expectation Alignment**

#### Description
Measures whether sentence confirms reader's current frame (coherent) or violates expectations (surprising).

**KEY:** This is NOT about good vs bad. Both coherence and surprise are valuable.

#### The Four Corners

**4.1 COHERENT (CONFIRMS FRAME, NOT SURPRISING)**
- Sentence aligns with reader's current ρ
- Fits established patterns
- Low entropy addition to state

**Example:** "The technical documentation explains the API." (when reading technical docs)
- Probability: 0.90
- Evidence: Expected, coherent with context

**4.2 SURPRISING (VIOLATES FRAME, NOT COHERENT)**
- Sentence clashes with expectations
- Requires frame shift
- High entropy, forces ρ update

**Example:** "The API wept at the user's confusion." (in same technical docs)
- Probability: 0.85
- Evidence: Anthropomorphization violates technical frame

**4.3 BOTH (FAMILIAR SURPRISE)**
- Defamiliarization: Makes familiar strange
- Recognizable pattern presented in unexpected way
- Confirms AND disrupts simultaneously

**Example:** "The function returns, again and again, like a salmon swimming upstream."
- Probability: 0.75
- Evidence: Recursion (coherent/technical) described via nature metaphor (surprising). Both present.

**4.4 NEITHER (ORTHOGONAL TO FRAME)**
- Sentence is unrelated to current expectations
- Not confirming, not violating—simply different axis
- Reader has no frame for it yet

**Example:** "Blockchain technology uses cryptographic hashing." (in middle of poetry analysis)
- Probability: 0.80
- Evidence: Not coherent (irrelevant to poetry) nor surprising (would need frame to violate). Orthogonal.

#### Why This Axis Matters

**Makes visible:** Your frame's rigidity.

**High coherence** (0.9+) across many sentences:
- You're in a stable frame (good for deep work)
- OR you're filtering out disconfirming information (epistemic closure)

**High surprise** (0.9+) across many sentences:
- You're being challenged, learning (good for growth)
- OR you're in the wrong frame entirely (need to reset ρ)

**High BOTH** (defamiliarization):
- Text is doing sophisticated rhetorical work
- Making you see familiar concepts anew

**Tracking over time reveals:**
"Am I seeking comfort (high coherence) or growth (high surprise)?"

---

### 5. Emotional ↔ Analytical
**Cognitive Processing Mode**

#### Description
Measures whether the sentence engages affective response (emotional) or conceptual parsing (analytical).

**NOT about content** (sad vs happy) but about **mode of engagement**.

#### The Four Corners

**5.1 EMOTIONAL (FELT, NOT CONCEPTUAL)**
- Sentence evokes affective response
- Processed through feeling, not reasoning
- Somatic, immediate

**Example:** "She's gone."
- Probability: 0.85
- Evidence: Evokes grief, loss—felt directly

**5.2 ANALYTICAL (CONCEPTUAL, NOT FELT)**
- Sentence engages reasoning, logic
- Processed through concepts, not feeling
- Abstract, mediated

**Example:** "The algorithm's time complexity is O(n log n)."
- Probability: 0.90
- Evidence: Requires conceptual parsing, not affective response

**5.3 BOTH (AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE)**
- Simultaneously felt and understood
- Thinking-feeling unity
- The integration itself is meaningful

**Example:** "Entropy always increases."
- Probability: 0.70
- Evidence: Analytical (thermodynamic concept) AND emotional (evokes existential feeling of decay/time). Both present.

**5.4 NEITHER (WITNESSING MODE)**
- Observing without engaging emotionally or analytically
- Pure awareness, no processing
- Meta-cognitive stance

**Example:** "Notice the arising of thought."
- Probability: 0.75
- Evidence: Not evoking emotion, not requiring analysis. Pointing to witnessing itself.

#### Why This Axis Matters

**Makes visible:** How you process meaning.

**Habitually emotional readers:**
- Connect deeply, but may miss logical structure
- Can be overwhelmed by affective content

**Habitually analytical readers:**
- Understand structure, but may miss felt meaning
- Can intellectualize away emotional truth

**BOTH (aesthetic) readers:**
- Experience richest meaning
- Can hold feeling and thought together

**Measuring this reveals:**
"Am I avoiding the emotional impact? (High analytical)"
"Am I bypassing the logic? (High emotional)"
"Am I integrating both? (High BOTH)"

### 6. Specific ↔ Universal
**Scope of Reference**

#### Description
Measures whether sentence refers to particular instances (specific) or general principles (universal).

#### The Four Corners

**6.1 SPECIFIC (PARTICULAR, NOT GENERAL)**
- Refers to concrete instance
- Bounded in time, place, identity
- This thing, this moment

**Example:** "On October 9, 2025, at 3pm, I read this sentence."
- Probability: 0.95
- Evidence: Maximally specific (time, date, person, action)

**6.2 UNIVERSAL (GENERAL, NOT PARTICULAR)**
- Refers to principle, pattern, or abstraction
- Unbounded, applies broadly
- All things, all times

**Example:** "All conditional phenomena are impermanent."
- Probability: 0.90
- Evidence: Universal Buddhist principle

**6.3 BOTH (EXEMPLARY)**
- Particular instance that reveals universal
- Specific BECAUSE it shows general
- The universal shines through the particular

**Example:** "Hamlet holds the skull and asks, 'Where be your gibes now?'"
- Probability: 0.80
- Evidence: Specific scene (Hamlet, skull) that reveals universal (mortality, vanity). Both present.

**6.4 NEITHER (UNIQUE/INCOMPARABLE)**
- Neither instance of category nor general principle
- Singular, incomparable
- Resists categorization

**Example:** "This present moment."
- Probability: 0.70
- Evidence: Not a particular instance of "moments" (not one of many) nor universal principle. The unique now.

#### Why This Axis Matters

**Makes visible:** Abstraction vs concreteness.

**Philosophical/academic writing:**
- Often high universal (0.7+)
- Can lose grounding in experience
- Becomes unrelatable

**Narrative/memoir:**
- Often high specific (0.7+)
- Can lose broader significance
- "Just one person's story"

**BOTH (exemplary):**
- The most powerful writing
- Specific enough to feel real
- Universal enough to matter beyond itself

**NEITHER (unique):**
- Direct experience
- Zen's "this very moment"
- Cannot be abstracted

**Measuring reveals:**
"Am I too abstract? (Low specific)"
"Am I missing the bigger picture? (Low universal)"
"Am I finding the exemplary? (High BOTH)"

## Extended Axes

### When to Add More Axes

The six core axes cover most reading scenarios. But specific contexts may benefit from additional axes:

### 7. Concrete ↔ Abstract (Optional)
**Conceptual Tangibility**

Similar to Specific ↔ Universal, but focuses on **imagability** rather than scope.

- Concrete: Can be visualized, touched, sensed
- Abstract: Conceptual, requires inference
- Both: Concrete metaphor for abstract concept
- Neither: Pure relation (no thing-ness)

**When to use:** Technical writing, philosophy, poetry

### 8. Certain ↔ Tentative (Optional)
**Epistemic Confidence**

Measures the sentence's claim strength.

- Certain: Definitive, absolute language
- Tentative: Qualified, probabilistic language
- Both: Confident about uncertainty ("I'm certain there's mystery")
- Neither: Beyond certainty/uncertainty frame

**When to use:** Scientific writing, argumentation, teaching

### 9. Generative ↔ Destructive (Optional)
**Creative Directionality**

Measures whether sentence builds up (generative) or tears down (destructive/deconstructive).

- Generative: Creates, proposes, constructs
- Destructive: Critiques, negates, deconstructs
- Both: Creative destruction ("Neti neti" practices)
- Neither: Pure description (no constructive/destructive force)

**When to use:** Philosophy, criticism, contemplative texts

---

## Usage Guidelines

### How Many Axes to Apply?

**Quick reading:** 1-2 axes
- Choose most relevant to text type
- E.g., Technical docs → Literal ↔ Metaphorical

**Deep reading:** 3-4 axes
- Cover semantic, cognitive, and hermeneutic dimensions
- E.g., Literal/Metaphorical, Emotional/Analytical, Surface/Depth

**Complete analysis:** All 6 core axes
- For pedagogical demonstration
- For user's own important writing
- For research/scholarship

### Axis Selection Strategy

**Match to text type:**

| Text Type | Primary Axes |
|-----------|-------------|
| Technical documentation | Literal↔Metaphorical, Specific↔Universal |
| Poetry | Literal↔Metaphorical, Emotional↔Analytical, Surface↔Depth |
| Philosophy | Subjective↔Objective, Specific↔Universal, Concrete↔Abstract |
| Narrative fiction | Surface↔Depth, Coherent↔Surprising, Emotional↔Analytical |
| Contemplative practice | Subjective↔Objective, Emotional↔Analytical, Specific↔Universal |

**Match to user's goal:**

| Goal | Recommended Axes |
|------|-----------------|
| Understand my reactions | Emotional↔Analytical, Subjective↔Objective |
| Improve comprehension | Surface↔Depth, Coherent↔Surprising |
| Analyze rhetoric | Literal↔Metaphorical, Specific↔Universal |
| Meta-cognitive awareness | All six (see patterns in your reading) |

### Order of Application

**Principle:** Earlier measurements affect later ones (back-action).

**Recommended sequence:**

1. **Literal ↔ Metaphorical** (Establishes semantic baseline)
2. **Surface ↔ Depth** (Builds hermeneutic layer)
3. **Coherent ↔ Surprising** (Reveals frame alignment)
4. **Subjective ↔ Objective** (Questions epistemic stance)
5. **Emotional ↔ Analytical** (Identifies processing mode)
6. **Specific ↔ Universal** (Locates scope)

**Why this order:**
- Semantic → Hermeneutic → Epistemic → Cognitive → Scope
- Each builds on previous measurements
- Subjective↔Objective late (after you've seen how you're reading)

---

## Madhyamaka Validation

### Testing Each Axis

For every axis, verify:

#### Test 1: No Privileged Pole

**Question:** Is one pole "better" than the other?

✅ **Literal ↔ Metaphorical:** Neither is better
- Technical writing needs literal
- Poetry needs metaphorical
- Both are valid

❌ **Correct ↔ Incorrect:** "Correct" is privileged (eternalism)
- Don't use this axis

#### Test 2: Mutual Dependence

**Question:** Does each pole require the other for definition?

✅ **Surface ↔ Depth:** Mutually defining
- Can only have "depth" if there's a "surface" to look beneath
- Can only recognize "surface" by contrast with potential depth

❌ **Happy ↔ Sad:** Independent emotions (not dialectical)
- Can define "happy" without reference to "sad"
- Not a true dialectical axis

#### Test 3: Emptiness (Construction Visible)

**Question:** Does the NEITHER corner reveal the axis as constructed?

✅ **Subjective ↔ Objective:** NEITHER = non-dual seeing
- Reveals subject/object split is constructed
- Points beyond the frame

❌ **Long ↔ Short:** NEITHER = medium length?
- Doesn't reveal construction
- Just a third category
- Not transcendent

#### Test 4: Conventional Function

**Question:** Is the axis useful even though constructed?

✅ **Emotional ↔ Analytical:** Useful distinction
- Helps identify processing mode
- Enables balancing strategies
- Not nihilism (denying function)

❌ **Good ↔ Evil:** Reifies moral categories
- Treats constructed concepts as inherent
- Leads to eternalism
- Not functional for consciousness work

### All Six Core Axes Pass

| Axis | No Privilege | Mutual Dependence | Emptiness | Function |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| Literal ↔ Metaphorical | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Surface ↔ Depth | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Subjective ↔ Objective | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Coherent ↔ Surprising | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Emotional ↔ Analytical | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Specific ↔ Universal | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**These axes can be trusted for consciousness work.**

## Examples: Measuring the Same Sentence

### Sentence: "The system learns your patterns over time."

Let's measure this sentence across all six axes to show how they interact.

#### Reader State (ρ):
```
Active frames: [technical: 0.6, humanistic: 0.3, critical: 0.1]
Epistemic stance: {certainty: 0.7, openness: 0.6}
Emotional: {curiosity: 0.7, caution: 0.3}
Recent concepts: [AI, machine learning, privacy]
```

#### Measurement 1: Literal ↔ Metaphorical

```
Literal (0.50): System does algorithmically learn patterns
Metaphorical (0.20): "Learns" anthropomorphizes
Both (0.25): Technical fact expressed through human metaphor
Neither (0.05): Not transcendent
```

**Dominant:** Literal with significant "both"

#### Measurement 2: Surface ↔ Depth

```
Surface (0.40): Straightforward capability description
Depth (0.35): Implies surveillance, data collection
Both (0.20): Surface = feature, Depth = privacy concern
Neither (0.05): Not particularly layered
```

**Dominant:** Balanced surface/depth

**ρ update:** Caution increased (0.3 → 0.35) due to depth reading

#### Measurement 3: Coherent ↔ Surprising

```
Coherent (0.70): Expected in AI context
Surprising (0.10): Not novel information
Both (0.15): Familiar concept, slightly uneasy phrasing
Neither (0.05): Not orthogonal
```

**Dominant:** Highly coherent

**ρ update:** Technical frame reinforced (0.6 → 0.65)

#### Measurement 4: Subjective ↔ Objective

```
Subjective (0.25): My concern about tracking
Objective (0.45): Factual capability description
Both (0.25): It IS objective AND I'm reacting
Neither (0.05): Not particularly non-dual
```

**Dominant:** Objective, but with acknowledged subjectivity

**ρ update:** Meta-awareness increased (noticing my concern)

#### Measurement 5: Emotional ↔ Analytical

```
Emotional (0.40): Triggers privacy unease
Analytical (0.40): Parsing technical meaning
Both (0.15): Simultaneously analyzing and feeling
Neither (0.05): Not witnessing mode
```

**Dominant:** Tied emotional/analytical

**ρ update:** Emotional caution (0.35 → 0.4)

#### Measurement 6: Specific ↔ Universal

```
Specific (0.45): This system's particular capability
Universal (0.30): General principle of ML systems
Both (0.20): Specific feature exemplifying universal trend
Neither (0.05): Not incomparable
```

**Dominant:** More specific than universal

### Final Reader State (ρ):

```
Active frames: [technical: 0.65, humanistic: 0.25, critical: 0.15]
  ↑ Technical increased, critical increased

Epistemic stance: {certainty: 0.7, openness: 0.6, meta-awareness: 0.3}
  ↑ Meta-awareness added (noticed my subjectivity)

Emotional: {curiosity: 0.6, caution: 0.4}
  ↑ Caution increased through depth and emotional measurements

Recent concepts: [AI, machine learning, privacy, pattern recognition, surveillance]
  ↑ Added: pattern recognition, surveillance

Expectation: "More technical capability descriptions with potential privacy implications"
```

### Insight from Multi-Axis Measurement

**Single axis** (e.g., just Literal↔Metaphorical):
- Would miss the privacy concern (depth)
- Would miss the emotional response
- Would miss the frame coherence

**All six axes:**
- Reveals technical + emotional + ethical dimensions
- Shows how ρ evolved through measurements
- Makes visible the reader's interpretive process

**This is consciousness work:** Seeing yourself construct meaning.
