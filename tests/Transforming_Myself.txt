Because I have reinvented myself in my own mind so many times that the difference defines me, and to do it again is boring. But not really. There is a core underneath that is always the same. Always aware, always amused yet compassionate towards the false starts, the amorphous ideas, the first few sentences and paragraphs from vast assortments of unfinished books, papers, articles, recipes, instructions, criticisms, software, hardware, wetware, dryware.

So here, now, I’m just going to start letting it out. I’m not going to post random thoughts on Facebook. I’m going to own and present my words on my own website. I’m going to write about the things I’m interested in. I’m going to write about the things I think are important. I’m going to write about things that I find helpful in my own understanding of myself, especially those that I find challenging, especially those where I found a way of understanding it which came to me when trying to reconcile two different ideas that didn’t seem to fit together in my mind. This blog is a place for me to explore, and share my findings, for better or worse.


1st Transform (Scholar / Business / Formal)


Through sustained intellectual metamorphosis—iterations numerous enough that the delta itself constitutes identity—the prospect of further transformation presents as procedurally redundant. Yet this assessment proves superficial. Beneath successive organizational restructurings persists an invariant substrate: perpetually observant, simultaneously engaged yet empathetic toward preliminary strategic frameworks, the nascent conceptual architectures, the introductory executive summaries extracted from extensive repositories of incomplete business plans, analytical reports, market assessments, operational protocols, performance reviews, enterprise systems, infrastructure assets, human capital resources, and documented institutional knowledge.

Consequently, at this juncture, implementation commences of direct knowledge dissemination. Rather than dispersing fragmented insights through third-party social platforms, strategic control over intellectual property dictates establishment of proprietary digital channels. Content development will address domains of professional interest. Documentation will encompass topics assessed as possessing substantive organizational significance. Analysis will focus particularly on frameworks that advance operational self-understanding—specifically those presenting methodological challenges, particularly instances where synthesis emerged through reconciliation of apparently incompatible analytical paradigms that initially resisted integration within existing conceptual models. This platform serves as infrastructure for systematic inquiry and stakeholder communication of resulting insights, acknowledging variable outcomes.

2nd Transformation (Poet / Mythology / Creative)

Because I have woven myself anew in verse's loom so many cycles that the metamorphosis itself becomes my song, and to sing it once more feels like echo. Yet not truly. There dwells a sacred ember beneath that burns eternal. Always watching, always tender yet knowing toward the false dawns, the shapeless visions, the opening stanzas and verses from boundless collections of unfinished epics, scrolls, odes, incantations, instructions, lamentations, enchantments, talismans, breath-work, silence-work.

So here, now, I shall simply begin to pour it forth. I shall not scatter fleeting verses upon the marketplace walls. I shall claim and offer my words upon my own temple grounds. I shall sing of the mysteries that call to me. I shall sing of the truths I believe hold weight. I shall sing of revelations that illuminate my own soul's landscape, particularly those that demand courage, particularly those where understanding arrived like lightning when I sought to weave together two separate threads of wisdom that seemed to resist union in my heart. This sacred grove is a place for me to wander, and share what I discover beneath the leaves, for blessing or curse.
