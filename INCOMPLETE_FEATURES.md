# Incomplete Features - Image Browser & Photos.app Integration

## Session Ended: Oct 6, 2025

### ‚è≥ What's Incomplete

#### 1. **Photos.app Direct Album Viewing**
**Status**: Export-only workflow implemented
**What works**:
- Albums list loads from Photos.app
- Can export album (up to 50 photos) to /tmp
- Can export recent photos (last 30 days, up to 100)

**What's missing**:
- Cannot view Photos.app images directly in the browser without exporting
- No way to browse full-resolution Photos.app images inline
- Export ‚Üí Upload workflow is clunky

**Why incomplete**:
- Photos.app doesn't expose direct file paths via AppleScript
- Would need to either:
  a) Auto-export on album select (expensive)
  b) Use Photos.app's internal database (complex)
  c) Keep current export workflow (current solution)

**Recommendation**: Keep export workflow for now, but add auto-cleanup of /tmp exports

---

#### 2. **Library Images Filtering in Photos.app View**
**Status**: Confusing UX
**Issue**: When in Photos.app view, the main grid still shows Library images until an album is selected. This creates confusion about what you're viewing.

**What should happen**:
- When clicking "Photos.app" button, hide Library grid
- Show album selection UI immediately
- Only show images when an album is exported and uploaded

**Quick fix needed**: Hide Library grid when `view === 'photos'`

---

#### 3. **Infinite Scroll State Management**
**Status**: Works but could be better
**What works**:
- Infinite scroll loads 100 images at a time
- IntersectionObserver triggers next page

**What's missing**:
- No way to jump to a specific page/date
- No visual feedback for total count
- Search/filter resets scroll position

**Recommendation**: Add pagination controls or date range selector

---

#### 4. **Image Metadata ‚Üí Transformation Links**
**Status**: TODO placeholder
**File**: `backend/api/library_routes.py:684`

**Code**:
```python
# TODO: Find transformations that reference this media
# For now, transformations list is empty
# Will be implemented when transformation linkage is established
```

**What's needed**:
- Establish foreign key relationship between TransformationJob and Media
- Or use JSONB metadata search to find transformations that reference media
- Display transformation list in metadata panel

---

#### 5. **Photos.app Export UX**
**Status**: Functional but clunky
**Current flow**:
1. Image Browser ‚Üí Photos.app ‚Üí Select album
2. Click "Export Album"
3. Alert shows /tmp path
4. Close Image Browser
5. Go to Import tab ‚Üí Images ‚Üí Select Folder
6. Navigate to /tmp path
7. Upload

**Better flow**:
- After export, show inline upload dialog
- Or auto-navigate to Import tab with folder pre-selected
- Or show exported images inline immediately

### ‚úÖ What's Complete

1. ‚úÖ Infinite scroll for Library images (100 per page, loads all 8,640+)
2. ‚úÖ Gizmo ID double-click editing (fixed text selection issue)
3. ‚úÖ Image metadata endpoint with conversation/message links
4. ‚úÖ Navigate from image ‚Üí source conversation
5. ‚úÖ Photos.app album export buttons
6. ‚úÖ Search and filter by generator type
7. ‚úÖ Detailed metadata panel with AI prompts, EXIF, dimensions

### üîß Quick Fixes for Next Session

**Priority 1: Hide Library grid in Photos.app view**
```jsx
// In ImageBrowser.jsx, around line 285
{!loading && !error && filteredImages.length > 0 && view === 'library' && (
  // ... grid code
)}
```

**Priority 2: Add auto-navigation after export**
```jsx
// After successful export:
window.openImportTab?.(); // Signal to parent to open Import tab
```

---

### ‚úÖ Fixed After Initial Documentation

**Export Path Changed**: `/tmp` ‚Üí `~/humanizer-agent/tmp`
- Easier to access from file picker
- All export functions updated in ImageBrowser and ImageUploader
- Directory created at `/Users/tem/humanizer-agent/tmp`

**Priority 3: Implement transformation linking**
```python
# In library_routes.py get_media_metadata
# Search for transformations by source_id or metadata
jobs_result = await db.execute(
    select(TransformationJob)
    .where(TransformationJob.config['source_media_id'].astext == media_id)
)
```
